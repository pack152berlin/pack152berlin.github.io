## **What Is the Pinewood Derby?**

The **Pinewood Derby** is one of the most exciting and time-honored traditions in **Cub Scouting**\! Each year, Cub Scouts receive an **Official Pinewood Derby® car kit** and team up with an adult partner to turn a block of wood into a one-of-a-kind race car.

Cars race down the track for speed—but our Pinewood Derby is about so much more. We celebrate **creativity, craftsmanship, teamwork, and Scout spirit**, with awards for both racing and design.

## **Pinewood Derby Pit Stop (Kickoff Event)**

We kick off Pinewood Derby season in **January** with our **Pinewood Derby Pit Stop**\!

At this fun event, Scouts will:

* Receive their official Pinewood Derby car kit  
* Take part in hands-on activities  
* Work toward earning their **Race Time Adventure**  
* Get inspired (and excited\!) for race day

## **What’s in the Pinewood Derby Kit?**

Each **Official Pinewood Derby kit** includes everything you need to get started:

* 1 wooden car block  
* 4 plastic wheels  
* 4 nail axles  
* 1 sheet of number stickers  
* Official instructions and basic rules

## **Building Your Pinewood Derby Car**

You don’t need fancy tools or a workshop to build a great Pinewood Derby car—**simple hand tools work just fine**.

**Adult assistance is required** for cutting and drilling.  
Scouts can safely:

* Design their car  
* Sand the wood  
* Paint and decorate  
* Choose colors, themes, and decals

Need tools or advice? Just ask—a **Scout is Helpful\!** Someone in the Pack will gladly lend a tool or a tip.

## **Pinewood Derby Rules (Keep It Fun\!)**

Our Pinewood Derby is all about **family time, learning, and fun**. In the spirit of the Cub Scout motto, **“Do Your Best,”** Scouts are encouraged to build a car they’re excited about and proud to race. Winning is exciting, but participation and pride matter most. Our goal is a fair, friendly, and fun race for all Scouts.

Please remember:

* Follow the rules included with the kit  
* Maximum car height (including wheels): **3 inches**  
* Final car weight is set at check-in using our **official scale**
