## Welcome to Cub Scouting!

Cub Scouting is a fun, educational program designed for youth in kindergarten through fifth grade (typically ages 5-10). It's built around hands-on activities, outdoor adventures, and character development that help young people grow into confident, caring, and responsible individuals.
- **Outdoor Adventures**: Hiking, camping, nature exploration, and outdoor games
- **STEM Learning**: Science experiments, technology projects, and engineering challenges  
- **Community Service**: Helping others through food drives, park cleanups, and volunteer projects
- **Skills Development**: Learning practical life skills, leadership, and teamwork
- **Arts & Crafts**: Creative projects that develop fine motor skills and imagination
- **Physical Activities**: Sports, games, and fitness challenges that promote healthy living

## Age Groups and Ranks

Cub Scouting is organized by school grade:

- **Lions** (Kindergarten): Introductory adventures with adult partner
- **Tigers** (1st Grade): Fun activities with adult partner focus
- **Wolves** (2nd Grade): Beginning independent scouting skills
- **Bears** (3rd Grade): More advanced outdoor and life skills  
- **Webelos** (4th Grade): Preparation for Boy Scouts with activity badges
- **Arrow of Light** (5th Grade): The highest Cub Scout rank, bridging to Scouts BSA

Each rank has specific adventures and requirements that scouts complete to advance, building confidence and skills along the way.
