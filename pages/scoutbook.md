## Scoutbook: Track Advancement & Stay Connected

**Scoutbook** is the official tool for Cub Scout families to track advancement, communicate with leaders, and stay up to date with Pack 152. Parents can view their scout’s progress, sign off on requirements, and receive important updates from the pack.

The **Scoutbook app** is available for both iOS and Android devices. The app works offline, so you can manage and view advancement opportunities and adventures even during campouts or holidays—no internet required!
