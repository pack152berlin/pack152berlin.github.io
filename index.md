## Our Mission

**Pack 152 Berlin** is dedicated to helping our children grow as people, leaders, and scouts. Through hands-on exploration of our vibrant city, we encourage curiosity, teamwork, and respect for others and the world around us.

## Our Goals

- **Personal Growth:** Building confidence and character through fun, challenging activities.
- **Leadership:** Developing responsibility and teamwork in every scout.
- **Adventure:** Exploring Berlin’s rich history, world-class **museums**, and beautiful **nature spaces** like the **Tiergarten** and **Grunewald Forest**.
- **Community:** Connecting with local organizations and giving back to our neighborhoods.

## Why Berlin?

Our scouts discover the wonders of Berlin—from the **Museum Island** and **German Museum of Technology** to the **Botanical Garden** and **Spree River** parks. Every outing is a chance to learn, grow, and make lasting memories.
